Introduction
------------

The standard F5 BIG-IP Virtual Edition (VE) images available from f5.com must be 'patched' in order to be compatible with Heat Templates in OpenStack. This repository's contents make it possible to patch and upload F5 VE images into OpenStack Glance.

The easiest way to patch a VE image for use in OpenStack is to use the F5 Heat template 'patch_upload_ve_image.yaml'. Please see the `F5 Heat User Guide <http://f5-openstack-heat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/map_heat-user-guide.html>`_ for instructions.

For Developers
--------------

VE Image Patching
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A VE image must be 'patched' to run in OpenStack. This allows for proper bootup of the instance with the correct interfaces and selfIPs. The ``patch-image.sh`` script in ``bin/`` does this work. If you would like to patch a VE image in a specific way other than what is provided in the ``ve_image_sync.py`` tool, you can use the ``patch-image.sh`` script directly:

``sudo /bin/bash patch-image.sh -f -s <your_startup_script> BIGIP_11.6.qcow2``

The above command patches the BIGIP_11.6.qcow2 image to be firstboot and injects a user-defined startup script before producing a patched image. The patched image will be created in $HOME/.f5-image-prep/tmp if no -o (output file) is specified. A minimal execution of the script might look like the following:

``sudo /bin/bash patch-image.sh -f BIG_11.6.qcow2``

Setup
~~~~~

To install the project requirements:

``sudo pip install -R requirements.txt``

Because the ``bin/patch-image.sh`` script manipulates the host kernel, it will only run successfully in environments that permit kernel manipulation (e.g., ``lsmod``, and ``modprobe nbd``).  THIS PRECLUDES THE USE OF (MOST) CONTAINERS!!
The script also needs to ``mount`` and ``umount`` filesystems (using the ``nbd`` drivers) so rights to devices/mount points, etc., are  necessary.

Currently, Ubuntu 14.04 has been verified to support the patch scrip; a patch for 16.04 is under review. 

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can either clone this repo, or use the command below to install it using ``pip``.
